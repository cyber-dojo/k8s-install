There are currently 4 slightly different versions of the helm_upgrade....() bash function.
Here are their names and which services use them.
In time, it would be good if these collapse to just one.


helm_upgrade_probe_no_prometheus_no.sh
    nginx

helm_upgrade_probe_no_prometheus_yes.sh
    saver

helm_upgrade_probe_yes_prometheus_no.sh
    web

help_upgrade_probe_yes_prometheus_yes.sh
    avatars
    creator
    custom-start-points
    differ
    exercises-start-points
    languages-start-points
    model
    repler
    runner
    shas


These bash scripts are curled by service CI scripts and by
